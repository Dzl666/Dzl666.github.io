This project was conducted within Robotics System Lab at ETH Zurich.

Descriptions:
  -	Incorporated LiDARâ€™s depth instead of stereo-based depth to improve accuracy and consistency of GS SLAM.
  -	Implemented a loosely coupled, optimization-based LVIO system by fusing Lidar and RGB data.
  -	Outperformed other GS-SLAM methods by the time on localization accuracy and processing speed.
