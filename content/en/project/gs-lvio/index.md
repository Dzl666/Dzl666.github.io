This project was conducted within Robotics System Lab at ETH Zurich.

Descriptions:
  - Incorporation of LiDAR depth information instead of Stereo based depth improving accuracy and consistency of GS SLAM
  - Implemented a loosely coupled, optimization-based LVIO system by fusing Lidar and RGB data.
