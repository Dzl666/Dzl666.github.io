This project was conducted within Computer Vision and Geometry group at ETH Zurich.

Descriptions:
  - Modified and extended the ‘Depth-Supervised NeRF’ pipeline for reconstructing indoor environments using the depth prior.
  - Achieved good reconstruction quality in the bedroom scene given limited training frames (Sparse NeRF)
