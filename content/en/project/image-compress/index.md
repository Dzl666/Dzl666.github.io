My bachelor's thesis for the BEng degree in Computer Science.

Descriptions:
  - Designed an Embedding-MLP-PixelShuffle pipeline to compress single image based on neural representation.
  - Designed a medical microscope image-based subsampling algorithm to reduce image size at the sending end and deployed a neural representation network for super-resolution of the decompressed image at the receiving end.
